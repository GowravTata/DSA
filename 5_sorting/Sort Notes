Sorting: The method in which all the elements in the datastructure are sorted in ascending or descending order


Two methods of sorting:
1. sort: can be applied to list.
2.sorted:  it works for all kinds of iterable containers. it does not alter the past container but it returns a
new list.so it works for mutable and immutable containers.

Tim Sort Algorithm: It is the algorithm that uses both merge sort and insertion sort internally.

The two parameters that sort takes are key, reverse

Role of sort in python
1. It internally uses TimSort Algorithm
2. It is stable, meaning elements are returned based on their initial position if they are same
3. Works only for list ( as list are mutable)
4. Modifies the same list
